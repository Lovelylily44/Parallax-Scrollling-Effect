        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>Some web design trends stand the test of time. We're not talking about Comic Sans and Flash-based animations, here — they can stay in the early 2000s. But the parallax effect is still as hot today as it was when it came to prominence on the web in 2011.</p>

        <p>In this post, we'll walk you through what a parallax effect is, the benefits of using it, and some examples to give you a better sense of how to apply it.</p>
        
        <p>Let's dive in!</p>
        
        <h3>What is a parallax effect?</h3>
        <p>Have you ever scrolled through a page that felt dynamic? As if you were scrolling through more than one view at once? That's a parallax effect, and it happens when the different elements of a page move at different speeds — creating a 3D depth effect.</p>
        
        <p>What's often happening is that the background image will be held in place or move slowly while the images and text on the page scroll normally.</p>
        <h3>What are the benefits of using a parallax effect?</h3>
<p>The parallax effect is a great way to enrich a site, showcase products, and create a sense of immersion. Now that we have some idea of what a parallax scrolling effect is, let's take a look at the different benefits of using it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3D depth:</strong> By separating layers and moving them at different speeds, you trick the user's mind into perceiving 3D depth.</li>
<li><strong>Sense of scale:</strong> Having more elements on different levels lets you differentiate them from each other and gives a sense of scale that's usually difficult to convey with 2D static images.</li>
<li><strong>Targeting user focus:</strong> If you want to keep your user's eyes on a specific element, scrolling effects let you seemingly animate something or everything else around it to maintain focus.</li>
<li><strong>Break up content:</strong> B2B sites frequently use parallax effects to showcase important company offerings. These sites have a lot of information, so it's a good way to break up the content.</li>
<li><strong>Modern design:</strong> Sleek flowing designs are part of a modern web and mobile app aesthetic that companies from all industries follow. Make the most of scrolling effects to keep your designs current.</li>
</ul>
